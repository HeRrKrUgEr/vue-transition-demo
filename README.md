This repo contains the code for a demo from our blog post "Creating Vue.js Transitions & Animation: Live Examples".

"A transition is a simple change in the style properties on an element to be transitioned in a single step. They are often handled purely through CSS.

The simplest way to achieve transition effects on your page is through Vue's <transition> component. It makes things so simple, it almost feels like cheating. Vue will detect if any CSS animations or transitions are being used and will automatically toggle classes on the transitioned content, allowing for a perfectly timed transition system and complete control."
